I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Emory University where I am fortunate to work with [Dr.Ymir Vigfusson](https://www.ymsir.com/) as part of the [SimBioSys Lab](https://simbiosys.mathcs.emory.edu/). 

My research interests lie primarily in **storage systems** and **distributed tracing systems**, with the overarching goal of enhancing the efficiency and optimization of large-scale distributed systems.

On the storage system side, I focus on the theoretical analysis of caching systems and the design of efficient storage solutions. Meanwhile, in the realm of distributed tracing, I am particularly interested in utilizing tracing data to identify global bottlenecks and evaluate the impact of optimizations.
