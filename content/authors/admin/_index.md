I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Emory University where I am fortunate to work with [Dr.Ymir Vigfusson](https://www.ymsir.com/) as part of the [SimBioSys Lab](https://simbiosys.mathcs.emory.edu/).

My research interests include caching systems and distributed tracing. My current works focus on multi-tier caching performance and characteristics of distributed tracing data.
